      Each dish below is more than just a recipe — it’s a hard-won prize from battles against fierce, fruit- and veggie-themed foes.

      These pixel-perfect creations bring to life the charm of <em>A Warrior’s Recipe</em>, my fantasy RPG and restaurant management game where culinary skill and combat go hand in hand.

      These food pixel art assets were created for <em>A Warrior’s Recipe</em>, a fantasy RPG and restaurant management game where players cook up dishes using ingredients dropped by monsters. Each icon represents a different culinary creation, ranging from simple ingredients like carrots and mushrooms to fully prepared meals like tacos, dumplings, ramen, and even a stack of syrupy pancakes. Some of these dishes are crafted from ingredients collected in battle, giving them a fun narrative twist.

    <p>
      My goal was to make each food item visually appealing and instantly recognizable, even at a small scale. I used vibrant colors, soft shading, and clean silhouettes to ensure clarity and charm.
