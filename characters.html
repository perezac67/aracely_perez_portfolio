          This piece is a 2D painting of a real 3D Loki Funko Pop figure. One of the main challenges was translating the depth of a physical object into a flat medium. I focused heavily on working with grayscale values—using whites to highlight raised surfaces and blacks to push back shadows, creating the illusion of depth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was turning a 3D character into a 2D artwork, it was important to capture every detail accurately—from the shape of the helmet to the subtle curves and textures of the figure. My goal was to make it feel like you could almost reach out and pick it off the screen.

        <p>This is a main menu scene I created for a game project. I began the process by sketching three different layout concepts and presenting them to the design team. After some discussion, they chose one that best captured the tone we were aiming for. With that direction locked in, I moved forward by refining the sketch, adding color, lighting, and detailed elements to bring the scene to life.</p>
        <p>However, the design evolved during development. I received feedback requesting the removal of the character positioned at the bottom of the screen to create a more open and immersive feel. The team also wanted the background to feel more alive, so I added new elements and visual depth to better reflect the world of the game. Additionally, since this scene was originally designed early in the project, I had to go back and update the go-karts to match the final in-game designs for consistency.</p>
        <p>What you see here is the finalized version of the main menu, complete with the user interface layered in. It was a collaborative process that helped me grow not only in visual design but also in adapting to creative feedback and iterative changes.</p>
