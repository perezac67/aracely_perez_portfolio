          This piece is a 2D painting of a real 3D Loki Funko Pop figure. One of the main challenges was translating the depth of a physical object into a flat medium. I focused heavily on working with grayscale values—using whites to highlight raised surfaces and blacks to push back shadows, creating the illusion of depth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was turning a 3D character into a 2D artwork, it was important to capture every detail accurately—from the shape of the helmet to the subtle curves and textures of the figure. My goal was to make it feel like you could almost reach out and pick it off the screen.

          Welcome to Treat Racer — a silly, high-energy game where you play as Pop the cat and race against Pap the dog and Pip the hamster, each mounted on wacky vacuums. The first animal to reach the finish line wins a mountain of tasty pet treats—and, of course, ultimate bragging rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game leans fully into a goofy and lighthearted style, and I reflected that in my design work by keeping things simple. Each pet racer was based on real animals I’ve known, which made the process more personal and fun. Pop was inspired by the lead coder’s beautifully colored cat, full of grace and sass. Pap, the wide-eyed, slightly clueless dog, was modeled after my cousin’s hilarious pug. And Pip, the chaotic little hamster, was inspired by my friend’s tiny mouse who never seemed to sit still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing these characters was not only creatively rewarding but also a way to bring a bit of real-world charm into our over-the-top racing world.
