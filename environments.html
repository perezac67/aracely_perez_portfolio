          This was a side project of mine—I had never done any building before this, but after completing it, I can confidently say that I really enjoy the process. The piece includes a cluster of futuristic buildings, each designed with small details like window patterns, signs, and rooftop structures to give them a sense of life and purpose. I paid special attention to the lighting, using a mix of neon signs and glowing accents to create a vibrant nighttime scene.

          I wanted to stick with a cyberpunk aesthetic, so I leaned heavily into a color palette of purples, dark blues, violets, and magentas. These tones helped capture that signature “cool at night” atmosphere, giving the scene an edgy, futuristic vibe. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to keep exploring this style in future builds.
