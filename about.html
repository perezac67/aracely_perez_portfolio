    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm a 2D artist and character designer with a strong passion for storytelling through visuals.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a Fourth-year Computer Game Design student pursuing my bachelor's degree, blending technical knowledge with creative artistry. I've been drawing since I was a child, and that lifelong love for art has evolved into a focus on crafting compelling characters and immersive worlds for games.</p>
    <p>My strengths lie in 2D illustration and animation, using tools like <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Procreate</strong>, and <strong>Aseprite</strong> to bring ideas to life. While 2D is my foundation, I'm also expanding into 3D modeling and texturing to better understand how my work fits into real-time environments and game engines.</p>
    <p>Above all, Iâ€™m passionate about creating art that enhances gameplay, tells a story, and sparks emotion in players.</p>
